    <h4 class="about-me-title">Software/Web Developer</h4>
    <p>I'm an Iron Yard Web Development graduate and a musician. My focus is in Java (Spring Boot) and I also have experience with SQL, SQLite, Postgres, Mongo, Node, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I enjoy the challenge of debugging and testing code, creating databases, and organizing what I've written into clean, readable code that works in harmony with the design objectives.</p>
