                                    <p>I'm an Iron Yard Web Development graduate and a french horn player. As a musician
                                        I use
                                        critical thinking to determine how to produce a beautiful sound on the horn. I'm
                                        excited
                                        to bring my problem solving skills to programming, and am open to
                                        relocation.</p>

                                    <p>In September 2016 I was accepted into a pilot 12-week program by SC Codes
                                        which focused on building front-end web applications and also gave me the
                                        opportunity
                                        to contribute to Code for Greenville's open source project. I enrolled in The
                                        Iron Yard's 12-week immersive coding bootcamp in May 2017 where I was able to
                                        dive
                                        deeper into front-end as well as learning back-end fundamentals.</p>

                                    <p>My interest in working with data and the server side led me to choose Java
                                        (Spring
                                        Boot) as my language focus. I also have experience with SQL, PostgreSQL, Mongo,
                                        Node.js, along with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I enjoy the challenge of
                                        debugging and
                                        testing, creating databases, and figuring out how to write code that meets the
                                        design
                                        objectives.</p>
