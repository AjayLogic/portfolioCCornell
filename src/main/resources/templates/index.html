                            <p>I'm an Iron Yard Web Development graduate and a french horn player. As a musician I use
                                critical thinking to determine how to produce a beautiful sound on the horn. I'm excited
                                to bring my problem solving skills to programming, and am open to relocation.</p>

                            <p>In September 2016 I was accepted into a pilot 12-week program by SC Codes
                                which focused on building front-end web applications and also gave me the opportunity
                                to contribute to Code for Greenville's open source project. I enrolled in The
                                Iron Yard's 12-week immersive coding bootcamp in May 2017 where I was able to dive
                                deeper into front-end as well as learning back-end fundamentals.</p>

                            <p>My interest in working with data and the server side led me to choose Java (Spring
                                Boot) as my language focus. I also have experience with SQL, PostgreSQL, Mongo,
                                Node.js, along with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I enjoy the challenge of debugging and
                                testing, creating databases, and figuring out how to write code that meets the design
                                objectives.</p>

                                work. I look forward to talking with you about becoming a member of your
                                team!</p>
